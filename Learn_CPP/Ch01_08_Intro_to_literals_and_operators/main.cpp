// Literals

/*

std::cout << "Hello world!";
int x{ 5 };

1. A literal (also known as a literal constant) is a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code.
2. the value of a literal is fixed and can¡¯t be changed (hence it being called a constant),
	whereas the value of a variable can be changed through initialization and assignment.

// Operators
/*
Unary : operators act on one operand. An example of a unary operator is the - operator

Binary : operators act on two operands (known as left and right). An example of a binary operator is the + operator.
		 (insertion: <<,  extraction: >>)

Ternary : operators act on three operands.
