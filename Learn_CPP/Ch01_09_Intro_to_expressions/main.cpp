	Expression: an expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and explicit function calls (not shown above)

	Evaluation : When an expression is executed, each of the terms in the expression is evaluated until a single value remains
	            (this process is called evaluation). 
				
	Result: That single value is the result of the expression.

	int w{ y };             // initialize variable w with value 5 (the current value of variable y)


	2               // 2 is a literal that evaluates to value 2
	"Hello world!"  // "Hello world!" is a literal that evaluates to text "Hello world!"
	x               // x is a variable that evaluates to the value of x
	2 + 3           // 2 + 3 uses operator + to evaluate to value 5

	std::cout << x  // x evaluates to the value of x, which is then printed to the console
